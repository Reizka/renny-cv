		<p class="body">
			This scenario isn’t particularly original. I can’t locate the original
			Reddit post anymore, but the core idea was a one-shot in which a dragon is
			terrorising a small town, pushing the party into a series of morally
			ambiguous (“shades of grey”) decisions.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			In this version, the adventure is designed for low-level characters and
			first-time players. Instead of a real dragon, the threat is an illusory
			dragon, allowing the scenario to create tension and spectacle without
			overwhelming inexperienced players with an unwinnable fight.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			The one-shot is structured to showcase the core elements of D&amp;D:
		</p>
		<ul class="body-list">
			<li>Problem-solving with multiple valid approaches</li>
			<li>
				Social interaction where suspicion does not automatically equal
				villainy
			</li>
			<li>Optional, clearly contained combat encounters</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="body">
			Combat can occur at a few points, but none of it is mandatory. Depending
			on pacing, table energy, or time constraints, the GM can easily skip or
			downplay these encounters without breaking the narrative.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			Overall, the scenario is intentionally flexible. It gives the GM room to
			either slow things down for exploration and roleplay or push the story
			forward when needed. In terms of difficulty, it sits at a low to medium
			level, primarily due to narrative decision-making rather than mechanical
			challenge.
		</p>

		<h2 id="summary">Story Summary</h2>
		<p class="body">
			The town of Littlefare has endured a difficult year. For the past twelve
			months, it has been terrorised by what the townsfolk believe to be a
			vicious and greedy red dragon. Every two to three weeks, the creature
			demands tribute. Whenever the town fails to meet its demands, a house is
			burned or destroyed as punishment.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			At first, Littlefare manages to comply, but its resources steadily
			dwindle. As the situation worsens, “dragon protection” becomes a source
			of revenue. Caravans passing through the town are forced to surrender a
			fifth of their cargo or face threats of an “unsafe journey ahead,” as they
			would be left unprotected from the dragon’s wrath.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			In truth, the dragon does not exist.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			Behind the scenes, a malevolent barghest named Mogawg has formed a
			mutually beneficial alliance with a cunning doppelganger, Naa Mio, and a
			small band of orcs. The barghest feeds on fear, and the slow erosion of
			Littlefare’s morale has left it well-fed and complacent.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			To maintain the deception, Naa Mio first murdered the town’s well-liked
			mayor, Aelric Venn, after closely observing him and learning his basic
			mannerisms. Disguised as the mayor, Naa Mio now rules Littlefare from the
			shadows.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			Using simple disguise tools and minor magic, Naa Mio has also outfitted
			several orcs to appear as the mayor’s personal city guards. Together, they
			stage the illusion of a dragon threat: Mogawg uses its shapechanging and
			levitation abilities to create convincing “dragon sightings,” while the
			orcs periodically burn outlying homes and kill their occupants to
			reinforce the illusion.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			Once fear has fully taken hold, Naa Mio escalates control. Hired ruffians
			are installed as additional “tax collectors,” ensuring that no caravan
			passes through Littlefare without paying the toll. Those who refuse are
			marked for raids carried out at a safe distance by Mogawg and the orcs.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			Several prominent figures in Littlefare suspect that something is wrong,
			but fear keeps them silent. They worry for their families, their friends,
			and their own lives.
		</p>
		<div class="dm-block">
			<p class="dm-title">The Truth of Littlefare (GM Only)</p>
			<p class="body">There is no dragon.</p>
			<p class="body">
				The town is controlled by Naa Mio, a doppelganger who murdered the
				real mayor, Aelric Venn, and assumed his identity. Power is maintained
				through fear, staged destruction, and a pact with Mogawg, a barghest
				that feeds on terror and flesh.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				Orcs loyal to Naa Mio enforce tribute and tolls, while Mogawg sustains
				the illusion of a dragon through shapechanging displays and selective
				slaughter.

		<h2 id="running">Running This Adventure</h2>
		<p class="body">
			The players are Harper Investigators first, merchant envoys second. The
			emphasis should be on doing discreet investigation rather than punching
			every NPC in the face.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			Having said that, this one-shot is quite light on combat events, partly
			because of their time-consuming nature. There are plenty of options for
			adding them, such as an extra encounter with ruffians on the streets of
			the town.

		<div class="dm-block">
			<p class="dm-title">One-Shot Design Principle: Convergence</p>
			<p class="body">
				No matter how the players approach the investigation—combat, stealth,
				or social play—the adventure is designed to converge on a final
				confrontation with the source of the fear. However, the dining hall
				encounter is also an optional spot to cut things short if the session
				needs to be wrapped up and the conclusion narrated from there onward.

		<h4 id="act-1" class="act-title">ACT I – The Road to Littlefare</h4>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">Overview</h5>
		<p class="body">
			For several months, trade caravans traveling through the Littlefare
			region have failed to arrive in Waterdeep or have returned partially
			stripped of their cargo. In response, a loose alliance of merchants has
			pooled resources to send a small delegation to investigate the
			disruption.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			The party is officially hired as part of this merchant effort.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			Unbeknownst to the merchants, the Harpers are also watching the situation
			closely. While rumors of a dragon extorting a small town are widespread,
			no reliable proof exists. The Harpers suspect something more subtle and
			assign the party a secondary objective: investigate Littlefare discreetly
			and determine whether the dragon threat is real.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			The party is instructed to maintain their cover as merchant
			representatives.
		</p>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">Party Setup</h5>
		<p class="body">The characters already know each other.</p>
		<p class="body">
			They may be colleagues, associates, or trusted contacts who have worked
			together before, but they have all been deliberately selected for this
			mission. They are aware that:
		</p>
		<ul class="body-list">
			<li>Caravans have gone missing or been extorted</li>
			<li>Littlefare is the common link</li>
			<li>Claims of a dragon have circulated, but evidence is thin</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="body">
			The adventure begins with the party traveling together along the road
			toward Littlefare.
		</p>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">The Road Encounter</h5>
		<p class="body">
			A short distance from the town, the party encounters a stopped caravan on
			the road.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			A small group of ruffians has blocked passage and is demanding a toll
			equal to one-fifth of the caravan’s cargo, claiming it is required for
			“dragon protection.” The caravan driver refuses to pay and looks to the
			party—clearly well-equipped—for help.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			There are four ruffians in total. They are confident but not disciplined,
			and they do not appear eager for a prolonged fight.
		</p>
		<p class="body">This encounter establishes:</p>
		<ul class="body-list">
			<li>The toll system</li>
			<li>The use of the dragon threat as justification</li>
			<li>Early player agency and consequence</li>
		</ul>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">Resolving the Encounter</h5>
		<p class="body">The situation can resolve in several ways:</p>
		<ol class="body-list">
			<li>
				<strong>Social Resolution.</strong> The party may attempt to persuade
				the ruffians to stand down, intimidate them into backing off, or
				convince them to escort the caravan and party to Littlefare to “sort it
				out there.” If successful, one ruffian is sent ahead to warn the mayor
				of the party’s arrival.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Compliance.</strong> The party may convince the caravan driver
				to pay the toll and continue on their way. If this happens, the
				ruffians again send word ahead to the mayor.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Combat.</strong> If the encounter turns violent: once two
				ruffians are killed or incapacitated, one remaining ruffian attempts to
				flee toward Littlefare to warn the mayor. This escape attempt occurs
				unless the party actively prevents it. If all ruffians are dealt with
				before anyone escapes, no warning is sent.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="dm-block">
			<p class="dm-title">Mayor Awareness Trigger</p>
			<p class="body">
				If ruffians survive, are persuaded, escort the caravan, or collect
				tribute, word reaches the mayor.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				If all ruffians are eliminated quietly before anyone escapes, the mayor
				remains unaware of the party’s approach.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">End of Act I</h5>
		<p class="body">
			Regardless of outcome, the party continues onward toward Littlefare.
			 Act I ends as the town of Littlefare comes into view.
		</p>

		<h4 id="act-2" class="act-title">ACT II – Arrival, Control, and the Unraveling of Fear</h4>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">Overview</h5>
		<p class="body">
			Act II is the investigative heart of the adventure. The party arrives in
			Littlefare and begins to uncover cracks in the town’s official story.
			Fear, compliance, and quiet complicity define daily life here. Everyone
			knows something is wrong—few are willing to say it aloud.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			This act is intentionally flexible. The party may move cautiously or
			aggressively, socially or stealthily. Regardless of approach, evidence
			accumulates and pressure increases, leading inevitably to Act III.
		</p>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">Arrival in Littlefare</h5>
		<p class="body">
			As the party enters Littlefare, several things are immediately clear:
		</p>
		<ul class="body-list">
			<li>The town is visibly run down, even by rural standards.</li>
			<li>Some buildings show signs of fire damage or hasty repairs.</li>
			<li>Streets are quiet, and people avoid lingering outdoors.</li>
			<li>Townsfolk avert their gaze, close shutters, and retreat inside when strangers pass.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="dm-block">
			<p class="dm-title">Tone of Littlefare</p>
			<p class="body">Littlefare is not panicked.</p>
			<p class="body">It is obedient.</p>
			<p class="body">
				People move quickly, speak quietly, and avoid attention. The town
				survives by not being noticed.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">Arrival Branch: Is the Mayor Aware?</h5>
		<p class="body">How the party is received depends on events in Act I.</p>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">Branch A – Mayor Aware of the Party’s Arrival</h5>
		<p class="body">
			If word of the party reached Littlefare ahead of them, they receive a
			formal reception shortly after entering town.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			At the town center, the mayor greets the party alongside:
		</p>
		<ul class="body-list">
			<li>A small number of personal guards</li>
			<li>Several notable figures from the town</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="body">
			The mayor presents himself as polite, cooperative, and relieved by
			outside help. He claims that he has repeatedly requested assistance
			regarding the dragon threat (this is a lie) and expresses willingness to
			support the party’s investigation.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			As a public gesture of goodwill, he offers the party lodging at the
			town’s only inn and instructs Martha Grayblum, the innkeeper, to host them
			at the town’s expense. Martha agrees, but hesitantly.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			The meeting is calm, orderly, and clearly staged.
		</p>
		<div class="dm-block">
			<p class="dm-title">Running the Mayor (Reminder)</p>
			<p class="body">The mayor is calm, controlled, and accommodating.</p>
			<p class="body">He does not argue.</p>

				If questioned directly, he answers around the truth.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">Branch B – Mayor Unaware of the Party’s Arrival</h5>
		<p class="body">
			If the mayor has not been warned, the party enters Littlefare without
			fanfare.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			There is no escort or official greeting. The party is free to explore,
			speak to townsfolk, and form impressions organically. NPCs remain cautious,
			and no one volunteers information freely.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			As the party becomes more inquisitive, guards may eventually request a
			meeting with the mayor, or the party may seek him out themselves.
		</p>
		<div class="dm-block">
			<p class="dm-title">GM Guidance: Let Them Breathe</p>
			<p class="body">
				If the mayor is unaware, allow the party time to investigate freely.
				This freedom should feel fragile.

			<p class="body">

		<h5 class="act-subtitle">The First Night</h5>
		<p class="body">
			The party arrives late in the day.
		</p>
		<ul class="body-list">
			<li>Shops are closing</li>
			<li>Streets are quiet</li>
			<li>The town is settling in for the night</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="body">
			This naturally limits investigation on the first evening and pushes the
			party toward rest.

		<h5 class="act-subtitle">The Morning Dew Inn</h5>
		<p class="body">
			Littlefare has only one inn: The Morning Dew, run by Martha Grayblum.
		</p>
		<p class="body">
			The inn is modest, worn, but serviceable. Martha is polite, guarded, and

			If the mayor is aware of the party’s actions, they receive an invitation

		<div class="dm-block">
			<p class="dm-title">Sneaking to the Keep</p>
			<p class="body">Note that ACT III assumes the party is joining the mayor for dinner. 
				GMs should be prepared to handle the case where the party does not join the mayor for dinner, and instead sneaks into the keep.
				You can flavour this type of approach with party witnessing a conversation that reveals the mayor's true intentions 
				or the presence of disguised guards or even the Bargheast's location.</p>

		<h5 class="act-subtitle">Overview</h5>
		<p class="body">
			Act III is the collapse of the lie. Whether through violence, deception,
			or exposure, the truth about Littlefare can no longer be contained. This
			act is intentionally volatile, but all paths converge toward a final
			reckoning with the true source of fear.
		</p>
		<div class="dm-block">
			<p class="dm-title">Act III Design Goal</p>
			<p class="body">
				Act III ideally leads the party toward the barghest’s lair and final confrontation.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				If pacing slows or outcomes branch too far, introduce information that
				points them forward.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h5 class="act-subtitle">The Invitation</h5>
		<p class="body">
			Act III begins once the party enters the mayor’s residence.
			The invitation is a clear signal that the mayor  is attempting to manage the party’s investigation and control the narrative.
		</p>
		<ul class="body-list">
			<li>A polite summons</li>
			<li>A guarded request</li>
			<li>Guards escorting the party “for a conversation”</li>

		<h5 class="act-subtitle">The Mayor’s Residence</h5>
		<p class="body">
			The mayor’s house is solid and defensible, but not extravagant.
		</p>
		<p class="body"> 4 - 6 members of the mayor’s personal guard are present.</p>
		<p class="body">
			These guards are actually orcs in disguise, concealed with mundane makeup
			and minor magic.

			<li>Calm</li>
			<li>Cooperative</li>
			<li>Helpful</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="body">
			He asks how the investigation is progressing and gently probes for what

			<div class="dm-block">
			<p class="dm-title">Dont forget that Mayor Is a Doppelganger</p>
			<p class="body">
				He can read surface-level thoughts: intent, suspicion, emotional focus.
			</p>
			<p class="body">
				Meaning that will likely know if the players are pretending to eat the food or otherwise cause hijinks.
				He can also use this to subtly manipulate the conversation.
			</p>

			<p class="body">
				If part of the party leaves the dinner under pretense, the mayor will know and may react accordingly.
				He may allow it, or he may use it as an opportunity to isolate and capture the character/s.

		<h5 class="act-subtitle">The Meal</h5>
		<ul class="body-list">
			<li>Well-prepared but restrained</li>

			If some characters succumb to the drug and others resist:
		</p>
		<ul class="body-list">
			<li>Chaos erupts</li>
			<li>Captured characters are transported directly to the barghest</li>
