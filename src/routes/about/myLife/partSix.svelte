		After finishing my studies I wanted to continue further with my studies and looking into
		educational games. I was very lucky to get a position at Ajou university
	</p>
	<p>
		I finished my Msc studies in time this time creating an adaptive educational game that adapted
		slightly depending on the users' learning and play style. Again a very fun project created using
		Unity3D and Springboot (backend) but equally happy the source code is lost to sands of time
