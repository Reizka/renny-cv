			<h1>2017 - 2022: VUB Belgium</h1>
			<p>
				After my Msc, I was not ready to start real work and instead had yet another very lucky
				chance as I was invited to do a PhD at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. I had also been invited
				for a Phd at a Finnish University but the chance to live overseas was far too oppoturnity to
				pass
			</p>
			<p>
				This time my project was more convoluted and COVID did not help, but in the end I managed to
				succesfully defend my thesis in July 2022 focusing on Social Engagement platforms and
				creating designg recommendations for them with older users specifically in mind
			</p>
			<p>
				The project involved number of smaller portions, such as creating a fully functional web
				application on React & Firebase, as well as, using Unity3D to create a game that was
				complimenting the project
