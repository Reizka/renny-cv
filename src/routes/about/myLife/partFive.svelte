		Comeleted my studies in Business Information Tech, a degree program intended to teach both
		business and programming with the idea of:"Jack of all trades, master of none"
	</p>
	<p>
		While at Haaga-Helia, I also took on the head tutor activities. My Thesis focused on creating an
		Eductional AR game for the Android device. The project was fun and I learned a lot, but I am
		somewhat relieved no one will ever get their hands on the source code
