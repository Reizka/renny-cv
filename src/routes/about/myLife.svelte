    <p> Spent nearly four years travelling Oceania and South-east Asia. I started off with a working holiday in Australia, before picking up a scuba certificate in Thailand and later finding work in Vietnam. Before coming back home I went to check out my roots in Israel</p>

    <h1>2012 - 2014: Haaga-Helia</h1>
    <p>Comeleted my studies in Business Information Tech, a degree program intended to teach both business and programming with the idea of:"Jack of all trades, master of none"</p>
    <p>While at Haaga-Helia, I also took on the head tutor activities. My Thesis focused on creating an Eductional AR game for the Android device. The project was fun and I learned a lot, but I am somewhat relieved no one will ever get their hands on the source code</p>

    <h1>2015 - 2017: Ajou Univeristy South Korea</h1>
    <p>After finishing my studies I wanted to continue further with my studies and looking into educational games. I was very lucky to get a position at Ajou university </p>
    <p> I finished my Msc studies in time this time creating an adaptive educational game that adapted slightly depending on the users' learning and play style. Again a very fun project created using Unity3D and Springboot (backend) but equally happy the source code is lost to sands of time</p>

    <h1>2017 - 2022: VUB Belgium</h1>
    <p> After my Msc, I was not ready to start real work and instead had yet another very lucky chance as I was invited to do a PhD at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. I had also been invited for a Phd at a Finnish University but the chance to live overseas was far too oppoturnity to pass</p>
    <p>This time my project was more convoluted and COVID did not help, but in the end I managed to succesfully defend my thesis in July 2022 focusing on Social Engagement platforms and creating designg recommendations for them with older users specifically in mind</p>
    <p>The project involved number of smaller portions, such as creating a fully functional web application on React & Firebase, as well as, using Unity3D to create a game that was complimenting the project</p>
