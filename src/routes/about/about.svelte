            Hello and welcome to my homepage! This site is mainly intended to work as an 
            online CV and show off some of my old projects and know how.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is not easy to nail down my exact are of focus in terms of employment as I mainly hail from academia.
            My main passion though mostly revoles around games and game development. But I have picked up some android and web development skills on the way as well
        </p>

        <p>
            Before starting my studies I spent four years travelling around Ocenia, South-east Asia and Israel. I worked in various different 
            jobs during this time and during the second half of my trip acquired my scuba-diving instructor license.
        </p>

        <p>After returning to Finland in 2012 I stared my Bacherlor studies at Haaga-Helia, where I completed the Business Information Technology (BITe) in 2½ years (it is normally a 3½ year program)</p>
        <p>I continued directly to Msc studies after completing my Bachelor studies and moved to South Korea for 2 years where I studied at Ajou University</p>
        <p>Lastly, I moved to Belgium to start my PhD, which I succesfully defended in July 2022.</p>
