	<h1>RPG Stories</h1>
	<p class="intro">
		Welcome to my RPG stories page. This is meant to work both as a portfolio
		to showcase my writing skills and as a resource for anyone interested in
		running the campaigns and one-shots I've written.
	</p>
	<p class="intro">
		For most readers, these stories won't contain unique revelations in terms
		of narrative design choices. In my RPG sessions, I often—and without much
		shame—borrow from existing bodies of work. Since the wheel is already
		there and quite shiny, I rarely see the need to make a new one that
		wouldn't be much better anyway.
	</p>
	<p class="intro">
		For D&amp;D, I use the term REMIX for campaigns that I've heavily modified
		from their original source material. I'm a huge fan of D&amp;D, but some
		pre-written campaigns include parts I simply don't like. I often keep the
		covers of the campaign while filling them with my own content. I've also
		used other forums for brainstorming; where relevant, I try to provide
		links to those sources.
